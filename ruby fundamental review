# Week 1, Day 2 Morning Discussion Questions
## Instructions
Take 30 minutes and answer the following questions together with your group.
Take turns playing around with the code provided in Pry or IRB.
## Questions
1 . What does the below method return?
```ruby
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"

greet("Steven") #=> ?
 => Hello,Steven
```

```
4 . Write a method that takes in an argument of a sentence and returns the
number of words in the sentence
```rb
word_count("Hi, isn't this a great and interesting sentence??")
 # => 9
 def word_count(sentence)
  words = sentence.split(" ")
  words.size
end
sentence = "Hi, isn't this a great and interesting sentence??"
puts word_count(sentence)
```
5 . What will the following method return?
```ruby
def friendly_greeting(name=nil)
 name ||= "friend"
 puts "Hey there, #{name}"
end
=> nill
```
6 . What will the following `puts`?
```ruby
best_animal = "cat"
favorite_animal = best_animal
puts favorite_animal
# => ?
=> cat
```
7 . What will the following `puts`?
```ruby
def my_favorite_animal
  "cat"
end
best_animal = my_favorite_animal
puts best_animal
=> cat
```
8 . What error, if any, will the following code raise?
```ruby
"Blink" + 182
=> Type error
```
9 . How would you `puts` out any and all foods that are delicious?
```ruby
foods = {
  "pie" => "delicious",
  "broccoli" => "not delicious",
  "carrots" => "not delicious",
  "apples" => "delicious",
  "peanut butter" => "delicious"
}
foods.each do |food, taste|
  if taste == "delicious"
    puts food
  end
end
```
10 . Delete all elements of the `foods` hash that are _not_ delicious.
=> foods.delete_if { |food, taste| taste != "delicious" }
11 . What is the return value of this method?
```ruby
character_names = ["Daenerys Targaryen", "Jon Snow" ,"Arya Stark", "Tyrion Lannister", "Sansa Stark", "Cersei Lannister", "Margaery Tyrell"]
def downcase_all(array_of_strings)
  array_of_strings.each do |one_string|
    one_string.downcase
  end
end
  => it will return original array_of_strings without any modification
```
12 . Write a method that `puts` out a random Agent Cooper quote.
```ruby
cooper = {
    "name": "Dale Bartholomew Cooper",
    "co-workers": ["Diane", "Sheriff Harry S. Truman"],
    "favorite_drink": "Coffee",
    "quotes": ["Damn fine cup of coffee", "Diane...", "This must be where pies go when they die", "That's what you do in a town where a yellow light still means slow down, not go faster.", "Every day, once a day, give yourself a present", "I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange."]
}
def random_cooper_quote(cooper)
  quotes = cooper[:quotes]
  random_quote = quotes.sample
  puts random_quote
end
random_cooper_quote(cooper)
```
